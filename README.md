# Turtle-Racing
This project is a fun and interactive Turtle Racing Game built using the Turtle module in Python. It's a part of my learning journey through the 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

A fun and interactive racing game created using Python's `turtle` graphics module. Watch six turtles race across the screen and see if your prediction wins!

## 🎯 Objective
The user places a bet on the turtle color they believe will win. The turtles then race at randomized speeds — making each race exciting and unpredictable!

---

## 📌 Features
- User input to select a turtle to bet on.
- Randomized turtle movements to simulate racing.
- Colorful visual representation using the `turtle` module.
- Simple yet engaging beginner-level project.
